# ThreeJSMod

To be fully honest I don't know how to put a picture in here. Anyway I did an embarrassingly simple change of reversing the direction of rotation in 2_shapes.html. I'm really sorry. I wanted to do more but it's late and I've been having medical issues and I would like to take my painkillers now... I think I get the gist of three.js though, it's like blender without the UI.
